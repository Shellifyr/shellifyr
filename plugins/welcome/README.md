# Welcome

This plugin simply displays a welcome message to the user, followed by the current time, every time a new session is launched.

To use it, add `welcome` to the plugins array in your `.shellifyrrc` file.

```sh
plugins=(... welcome)
```

This is merely a test plugin and it was the first one created for Shellifyr. Take it as some kind of Hello World.
